# Instance Segmentation on Tom and Jerry
12 December, 2021

## Project Description
This is a starter project for Brown Visual Computing Group. In this project, I re-implemented a U-Net model using TensorFlow 2 for image segmentation tasks. The data were collected from the famous cartoon *Tom and Jerry*, and the task was to locate and partition the Jerry Mouse in selected video frames. By training on 80 images and their true masks, the U-Net model has achieved an Intersection-Over-Union score of 0.8, significantly higher than random guessing.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 80 training images and 10 test images. It was generated from *Tom and Jerry* Episode 24, *The Milky Waif* (1946). Video frames were extracted and selected so that Jerry Mouse appeared clearly and completely, not obscured by other objects.

I used Labelme for pixelwise annotations.
